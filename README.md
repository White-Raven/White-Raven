# Hello people!ðŸ‘‹

I go by a fair amount of different names online, since some activities aren't really fitting to be mentionned in some community groups.
You can find my on my tech-related <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Achromatic_Raven/" target="blank">reddit account</a> where I mainly just hover around the homelab community.
From the activites I will mention here and there, I do a fair bit of webdev, front-end and back-end, but most of it is kept behind blinds in private repos.
Mainly having my fun with PHP, since I basically took a ~9 years hiatus in webdev, so haven't touched any of the node.js laravel react angular stuff.

I think MYSQL is barbaric because I'm yelling at the console window.

I have also my history with C++/C, VBScript, Lua, and I don't know why but I have a love-hate feeling toward Python.

I love enterprise hardware, so much I'm likely to run myself bankrupt on electricity bills.

I prefer functional over neat/good looking, so my living space is a visual apocalypse.

I'm also artsy on the side, but that's not the place.
